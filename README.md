# dwm - dynamic window manager (mhs version)

This is my (quite) patched version of dwm available in source-ready so that you don't have to waste the time patching on your own.

## Install
```shell
	git clone https://github.com/matthmr/mhs-dwm.git
	cd mhs-dwm
	make install
```

## Depends
- Standard Xorg/X11 libraries (e.g. `xlib`)
